      The recommended base job.

      All jobs ultimately inherit from this.  It runs a pre-playbook
      which copies all of the job's prepared git repos on to all of
      the nodes in the nodeset.

      It also sets a default timeout value (which may be overridden).

      A subset of what the 'base' job provides: the absolute minimum considered
      required to run for any one job.
      It doesn't set up cached git repositories, will not set up mirrors,
      doesn't validate the node, etc.
      It is meant to be used, amongst other things, to test roles and
      playbooks that would otherwise be included by default as part of the
      'base' job.
      These tasks, if required, can be included by the dependant jobs
      themselves on a need basis.
